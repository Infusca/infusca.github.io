          <p> I love coding and I currently know Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I've also done a little bit with VBA and Swift. I mostly work on creating websites and simple games along with some pixel art.  This page is a collection of different coding projects I've done either via tutorials / online courses, or on my own. </p>
          <p> Visit my <a href="https://github.com/Infusca?tab=repositories" target="new window"> GitHub </a> to see more.</p>

          <h5> Dig It All </h5>
          <p> Dig It All is a metal detecting game I made using Python. I am currently planning on making a new and improved, and more advanced version of the game. </p>
          <p> This version will only work on Windows. I did make a working Mac version, however it is not available to download yet. </p>
          <p> All images used in the game are real coins or relics that either Stef or I have found metal detecting. </p>
          <p> Download the game <a href="https://github.com/Infusca/DigItAll/raw/master/dig%20it%20all.zip"> Here </a>.</p>

          <h5> Minesweeper </h5>
          <p> As a kid, I loved minesweeper, so I decided to recreate it myself for coding practice. It's not quite complete, but here's what I have so far. It's written in JavaScript and will play in your browser. </p>
          <p> This current version does not work like real minesweeper. You can not right click to flag suspected bombs. In order to play, left click the squares you think are safe, only. Leave suspected bombs alone and when you think you've completed it, click the bottom button to find out if you won. The image to the right shows a completed winning game. </p>
          <p> Click <a href="code/minesweeper/minesweeper.html" target="new window">Here</a> to play. </p>

          <h6> Pig Game </h6>
          <p> A JavaScript game I made from a tutorial that is similar to the game Pass The Pigs (which I love - the pigs are so cute!). </p>
          <p> Take turns rolling die. Keep rolling to raise your score, or choose to hold, and keep your score and end your turn. If you roll a 1 you lose all points round. First to 100 wins. You can set the winning score to whatever you want. </p>

Click Play. Enter the corresponding number to select the answer. The game will tally up how many questions you get right. </p>

          <p> Here are a few mini games I made using Code Skulptor</a> </span>. Code Skulptor allows you to run python scripts in your browser. Once you click the link, just hit the play button on the top left to see the game in action. I am aware that these games may not be working properly at the moment.</p>
