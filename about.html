          <p> Hi, my name is Nichola Holcomb. </p>
          <p> I am a pharmacist. I work in retail, at Walgreens. I have worked for Walgreens since about 2018 or so, when they bought out Rite Aid. I was with Rite Aid originally since 2005 when I was an intern in college. </p>
          <p> Right now in my free time I mostly enjoy programming (websites, like this one, or simple games) & gaming. I also am interested in photography, reading, mountain biking, wood turning, guitar, piano, metal detecting, cooking, traveling, and camping. </p>
          <p> I enjoy collecting rocks, fossils, artifacts, and of course coins and relics I find metal detecting. I love all animals, but especially wolves, cats, and dinosaurs.</p>
          <p> The name of the website, <i>Smoke on Horizon</i> comes from a lyric from one of my favorite songs from one of my favorite bands: Fire Woman by The Cult.</p>
          <p> Feel free to contact me if you are interested in hot sauce, wood turned pens, or other wood turned items. </p>

          <div class="about">
            <h5> My Partner, Stef, aka StefDigs</h5>
            <p> I live with my partner Stef, since 2014, in my house, which is a beautiful log cabin home, in the woods. </p>
            <p> When I met Stef, she was an insurance agent. She has since left that to follow a dream in metal detecting. She has worked hard via social media to grow a following and now is affiliated with Minelab (one of the largest metal detecting companies). She is a Minelab Detexpert and also works for <a href="dddetectors.com">The Diggers Den</a>, a dealer, to sell metal detectors and equipment. She has a youtube channel and also has written several articles for <a href="https://diggermagazine.com">Digger Magazine</a> and has had some of her finds shown in the magazine as well as on the cover. She also is a talented musician, albeit out of practice, and can play bass, guitar, and drums. </p>
            <p> Be sure to contact Stef if you are ever looking for anything metal detecting related. You can reach her via the social media links below.</p>

          <p class="desc"> <b> Willow </b> <br> came to us through metal detecting. One of Stef's permission owners had a litter of kittens. She is a little cutie but a little standoffish. She doesn't like to be picked up or held, but she does like attention occassionally and loves to play. This picture here is her in the Christmas tree, her first Christmas. <br> <sub>2021 - </sub></p>

          <p class="desc"> <b>Petrie</b> <br> (named after Petrie from The Land Before Time) was found by Stef at The Dog House, in Manchester, CT. I don't approved of such places but I had lost Kayla that year suddenly and it was pretty traumatic. She was my baby. Stef was looking for a 'replacement' kitty for me. She went into The Dog House, 'just to look', and came out with Petrie, head on shoulder, already in love. I was shocked, only having known her for a few months. Although, I was relieved when I found out she was a minpin, and not a doberman (lol! - it was hard to tell from just a puppy photo). <br> <sub>2014 - </sub></p>

          <p class="desc"> <b>Cedric</b> <br> (named after the Harry Potter character) was through a family friend of Stef's who had a litter dropped on her doorstep. We thought he was part mainecoon because of his maine. We did a DNA test (getting the sample was lovely fun) and turns out he is mostly a mix of russian breeds which does include mainecoons amongst many others. He is a real sweetie, always in need of attention. Also a real furball who doesn't like to get brushed. <br> <sub>2015 - </sub></p>

          <p class="desc"> <b>Oscar</b> <br> arrived here shortly after Kirby, her baby, passed. Stef got him from a breeder at 1 years old. He is a french bulldog, full of happiness and energy. His favorite toy is a big bright orange ball, which he loves to bark at, slobber on, and chase around the yard for hours. <br> <sub>2016 - </sub></p>

          <p class="desc"> <b>Spike</b> <br> (another one from The Land Before Time) came from Petco. Neither of us had had a bearded dragon, or any reptile before but decided to go for it and he's definitely part of the family. As of now in 2023, he is almost 10 years old. My little dinosaur. <br> <sub>2014 - </sub></p>
